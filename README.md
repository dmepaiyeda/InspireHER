# The Solution
1. Expose female students to the various job opportunities there are in STEM
2. To get the students thinking about what they want to do in the future and as they head into a Post-Secondary institution  

# What is InspireHer?
InspireHer is a web application that provides a safe space for Grade 11 and 12 female high school students to get mentorship. It does so by connecting them with Industry Professionals in STEM-related fields to encourage them as they think about their interests and career paths.
